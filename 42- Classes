classes is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines Properties (Variables) and methodds (funciions) that object will have, 
and to use these variables and methods, u need to declare Object first from the Class, cuz u can't use these functions and variables on the class itself but objects
// # blueprint
class className {
  Attributes = variables
  Actions    = Functions
}

Ex.   class of car

//  definition of the class
class Car {
  String? brand;
  int? speed;

  void displayInfo() {
    print("The Brand is $brand, and the speed is $speed");
  }
}

// create object from this class

Car myCar = Car();      // create object
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.speed = 400;

myCar.displayInfo();

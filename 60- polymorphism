poly mor phism متعدد الاشكال

polymorphism is a concept  not code, but hting u understand
and u can't apply it without inheritance

polymorphism is about u store things with different types
if u have class Animal and inherit


Ex.
class Animal {
  sleep() {}
  walk() {}
}

class Lion extends Animal {
  roar() {
    print("roaring");
  }
}

class Kitty extends Animal {}

class Zebra {}

main() {
  print("Before object creation");
  Zebra zebra = Zebra();
  Kitty cat = Kitty();
  Lion lion = Lion();

  List<Animal> animalsZoo = [lion, cat];    // note that lion and cat are different types, but they inherit same parent, and try to add zebra to the list, you will get an error, cuz Zebra class doesn't inherit Animal
  // List<Animal> animalsZoo = [lion, cat, zebra];
  // but if u didn't specify the type of the List (which here is Animal)  then it will accept "zebra"
  // List animalsZoo = [lion, cat, zebra];  // but will be wrong usage, cuz animalsZoo List can store now anything! and this is wrong 
}

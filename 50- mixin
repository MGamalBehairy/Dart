mixin Swimming {

    print("I can eat 🍽️");

// Using the mixin inside the class

---------------------------  Difference between "mixin" and "implements" ---------------------------------
https://prnt.sc/IIuqyY5qJNDE


mixin uses the methods without need to rewrite the method again manually like "implements"

Ex. using mixin
mixin Flying {
  void fly() {
    print("I can fly! 🦅");
  }
}

mixin Swimming {
  void swim() {
    print("I can swim! 🏊‍♂️");
  }
}

class Duck with Flying, Swimming {}  // ✅ Uses mixins

void main() {
  var duck = Duck();
  duck.fly();  // Output: I can fly! 🦅
  duck.swim(); // Output: I can swim! 🏊‍♂️
}

- Ex.  using "implements" (hard way)
abstract class Flying {
  void fly(){
  print("I can fly");
  }
}

class Swiming {
  void swim(){
    print("I can swim");
  }
}
class Duck implements Flying, Swiming{      // Note: here u need to retype the methods again "override them"
  @override
  fly(){
    print("I can fly");
  }
@override
swim(){
  print("I can swim");
}
}

void main(){
  var duck = Duck();
  duc
}


- the difference between "mixin" and "implements"          "mixin"                        ,       "implements"
                                                   =>>   NO   Constructors                ,    can contain constructors
                                                   =>> uses existing methods as they are  , need to override and implement all methods manually
                                                   =>> use to reuse functionality         , used to Define Constructors
                                                   =>> u can insert abstract method in it , u need to insert "abstract" keyword to abstract methods and abstract class
                                "withoud inserting "abstract" keyword   like this   info();"

- use "extend" keyword with Classes,   while use "with" keyword with "mixin"

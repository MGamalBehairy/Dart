implements is like abstract,  but in abstract we define the method we need to override (maybe only one, we not need to override all methods) 

but in implements =>> it override all methods! and redefine all methods and Attributes !!

so implements differnet with abstract, that implements need to override every method and also "attribute"

Ex.

class Animal {
  String? color;
  eat();
  run(){
    print("The animal is running");
  }
}

class Lion implements Animal{    // implements Animal class 
  @override
  String color = "Black";    // note: even the attribute you need to override it
  @override
  eat(){
    print("lion is eating");
  }
  @override
  run(){
    print("lion is running");
  }
}

the class can contain more than one Constructor!!
u can have many constructors for different prupose

for example if u want to create circle,  so u need to know the x-axis  and y-axis  and radius
, but what if the cricle was at the origin, so u don't have to set the x and y axis with 0  cuz its already known

// circle with x and y axis
class Circle {
  int? x;
  int? y;
  double? radius;

  Circle({this.x, this.y, this.radius});

  // named Constructor
  Circle.origin({this.radius}) {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
  }

  void draw() {
    print('draw this circle at radius = $radius and center {$x,$y}');
  }
}

// but if u know, the center was at the origin, so u don't need to get the value of x and y (cuz it is 0)

// this how u make  " named constructor "

main() {
  Circle circle1 = Circle(radius: 8.5, x: 4, y: 6);

  // and to call named constructor, as next
  Circle circle2 = Circle.origin(
      radius:
          8.5); // first Circle is the class name and second one is the Constructor name

  circle1.draw();
  circle2.draw();
}

1- Arithmetic Operation

~/, +,  -,  *,  /,  %,   -expr => ex.  -a = -2 (if a = 2)
Important:
~/  => convert the output to Integer

var c = 9 / 4    // output = 2.25
var c = 9 ~/ 4    // output = 2

Using unary minus


2- Type Test Operators
NOTE it doesn't test Valuse but compare with data type
is  ,  is !    // output is boolean
Ex.
var a = 2;
var b = "mohamed";

print (a is int)  // output = true or 1
print(b is !string) // output = false or 0
//print(a is 2)  // Error, can't compare with values only with data types

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"as" operator in Dart:
- it onverts(typecast) one type into another
- it checks the type at "runtime" and throws an error if the conversation is  invalid

why use "as" ?
sometimes u declare a variable with dynamic or Object, so dart is not sure what type of this variable
so you tell dart I'm sure about the type of this variable and make it (String) for example

Ex.
dynamic value = 20;
int number = value as int  // you created a new variable and set it to equal the "value" variable and defined it as integer
print(number)

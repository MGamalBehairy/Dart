class Dog {
  
}
void main(){
  Dog jack = Dog();
  // when u type jack.     u will see many methods u can u use but u didn't create it,  so where these methods come from ?!!
                                                                                    // the ansert is from "object class" , cuz when u create class it extends (inherit) by default the object class
}

// so when u type this      class Cat{}        it is the same as this       class Cat extends Object{}

NOT Important:
Key Differences from Regular Comments
Multiple-line comments (/* */ or //): Regular comments are used for explaining specific parts of the code or for adding notes that are not meant for formal documentation.
Documentation comments (/// or similar): These are often parsed by tools to generate documentation in a consistent format.

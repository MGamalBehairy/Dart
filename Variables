* Var and Dynamic  Variables *

The DIfference between Var and Dynamic 
1-var:
After the type is assigned, it cannot change.
When you declare a variable using var, its type is inferred once when you assign it a value.
void main() {
  var name = "John"; // Dart infers that 'name' is a String.
  print(name); // Output: John

  // name = 42; // This will cause an error because 'name' is already a String.
}

2-dynamic:
When you declare a variable using dynamic, its type can change at runtime.
It allows you to assign different types of values to the same variable.
void main() {
  dynamic value = "Hello"; // Initially, 'value' is a String.
  print(value); // Output: Hello

  value = 42; // Now, 'value' is an integer.
  print(value); // Output: 42
}

When to use var and dynamic?
Use var when you know the type won't change.
Use dynamic if you need flexibility

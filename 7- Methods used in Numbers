Basics and Important Methods in Numebrs:

truncate() يقطع: Use when you just want the integer part, ignoring the fractional part completely.  // 5.9  => 5    just remove the Fractional Part
round(): Use when you need to find the nearest integer.      //  5.5  will be 6      and  8.4 will be 8
toInt(): Use when you want to convert a number to an integer but don’t care about rounding (similar to truncate()). same as truncate()
toString(): convert the integer or float number into text  // 5 => "5"    ,   54.454 => "54.454"
toDouble(): convert the integer number into Double.  // 5 => 5.0


Imp. 
you can use "num" data type , if you are Not sure if the varaible will be integer or double (depends on user input)

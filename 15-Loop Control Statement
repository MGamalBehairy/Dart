There are two Types:
1- break;
2- continue;


1- ////  break    ////

this statement used to break the flow of the control loop, Its used only within the loop, then it will terminate the loop
- It will bring the flow out of the "nearest loop".
Ex.

void main()
{
  int i = 1;
  while (i < 20)
  {
    print ("This loop number $i");
    if(i == 4)
    {
      print("the loop will break after it");
      break;
    }
  i++;
  }
}

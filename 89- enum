enum =>> used to store spefic limited options (value) 
used when u have known limited choices (u can count the choices)
like,   gender =>> male OR female
        months =>> Jan, Feb, March ....     u can count them

enum is like container =>> u put inside it the possible options and then create variable of type enum that hold the value of enum (one of enum options)

Ex.

enum Gender {        // create enum and options of it
  male , female
}

void main(){
  enum gender = Gender.male;    // create variable of type enum      , as this way there is no mistake can happened of mistyping 
  
}

// the best use of enum is with switch-case ,  but when use switch-case,  u must add all possible cases (options that exist in th enum)

Ex.

enum Gender {
  male , female
}
void main(){
  Gender gender = Gender.male;
  switch(gender){
    case Gender.male;
      break;
    case Gender.female;    // if u didn't add this case, u will get an error,   bucase u need to add all options
      break;
  }
}

constructors is a Special function and get executed automaticallyonce u create an object, (u didn't call the function, once u create new object, the constructor get executed), and the constructor name  should be the same of the class name. 
- so once u create an object, the constructors will be executed

Note the next 2 examples to see how constructors works.

Ex1.class car {
  var model = "s";
  var speed = 12;
  var color;
  info() {
    print("The model is $model");
    print("The speed is $speed");
    print("The color is $color");
  }
}

void main() {
  car car1 = car();
  car1.model = "BMW";
  car1.speed = 250;
  car1.color = "Black";

  car1.info();      // Note: here u called the "info()" function,   and if u didn't =>> nothing will be return
}  

//Ex2  using constructor
// same Ex as the previous,  just replace the "info" with "car" to be constructor. and also, don't call the function

class car {
  var model = "s";
  var speed = 12;
  var color;
  car() {          // replaced the "info" with "car", to be the same as the calss name
    print("The model is $model");
    print("The speed is $speed");
    print("The color is $color");
  }
}

void main() {
  car car1 = car();
  car1.model = "BMW";
  car1.speed = 250;
  car1.color = "Black";
  // Note: Even we didn't call the function,  the function get executed. 
}

- Dart String is a sequence of UTF-16 code units (the same as Python)
- You can use either 'single' quote or "double" quotes

Note:
- You can put a value of expression inside String usign "${expression}"    // This will convert whatever the type expression is into String (for example if the exression was integer or boolean, it will converted to String)
- also you can use "+" operator to concatenate with antoher Variable (string, integer, double...)


Very Important
                                         ---- Raw String ----

print("Hello \t guys");   =>> hello       guys
print(r"Hello \t guys"); =>> hello \t guys
 *Syntax
 String rawString = r"Hello\nWorld";  // Note: we added "r" before the string, the "r" is for => raw string
 *it used for:
 - Leteral Representation => used with Especial Characters (if you type   var rawString = r"Hello\nguys"  => the output will be "Hello\nguys")
 - Convince: Avoid the need to double back-Slashes (windows path)
 Ex1.
 void main() {
  String normalStringFilePath = "C:\\Users\\Documents\\Project";  // Note: we needed here to add double Slash 
  print(normalStringFilePath);
  // Output: C:\Users\Documents\Project

  String rawStringFilePath = r"C:\Users\Documents\Project";    // We just add one slash, cuz the Raw String represent the Strings as it(even the special Characters like \n, \t, \  ...) 
  print(rawStringFilePath);
  // Output: C:\Users\Documents\Project

*When to Use Raw Strings
When you want to include file paths or URLs without escaping backslashes or other characters.
When working with regular expressions or string literals that have many special characters.
When you need the literal representation of a string for logging, debugging, or other purposes.

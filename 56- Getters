- setter and getter are similar but with two diiferences
getter is differnet with setter
setter we don't define "datatype",  but in getter we get value, so we need to define the "datatype"
- also getter doesn't accept any parameters
- then we put "set" or "get" , then we make the setter or getter name same as with the attribute

// Ex.
int get numberOfArms => this._numberOfArms      // remember the name of setter or getter must be (highly recommended) same with the Private Attribute

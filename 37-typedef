typedef =>> is a shortcut for function type

Ex. 
Imageine you have a long street name:

"King Abdulaziz Road, Building 12, Apartment 5"

But instead of saying this long name every time, you create a shortcut name:  "My Home"
Now, every time someone asks you where you live, you just say "My Home", and they know what you mean.

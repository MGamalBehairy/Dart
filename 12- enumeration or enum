enumeration is a special data type that allows you to define a collection of constant values.

- Its used when you have a fixed set of relatd values like:
    - Traffic Light ("red", "yellow", "green")
    - Days ("saterday", "sunday", "monday"....)
    - Directions ("North", "South", "East", "West")

- enums are Immutable (Not Changable)
- enums defined before the main function
- the values doesn't come with quotations " ", even if the value is string
- provide the values after the enum name directly 
- Also it doesn't take semi-colon ;
like this:

enum Days {Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday}
void main()
{
}


// if you want to access the value
Ex.
enum Days {Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday}
void main()
{
   Days today = Days.Friday ;
   print("Today is $today");  // output: Today is Days.Friday
   // if you want to just print the value use .name
   print("Today is: $today.name)  // output: Today is Friday
}

Ex2.

enum trafficLight {Red, Yellow, Green}
void main()
{
    trafficLight light = trafficLight.Red

    switch (light) 
        {
            case trafficLight.Red:
                print("Stop!");
                break;
        
            case trafficLight.Yellow:
                print("Get Ready!");
                break;

            case trafficLight.Green:
                print("GO!");
                break;
        }
}


enum TrafficLight { Red, Yellow, Green }

void main() {
  var light = TrafficLight.Red;

  switch (light) {
    case TrafficLight.Red:
      print("Stop!");
      break;
    case TrafficLight.Yellow:
      print("Get Ready!");
      break;
    case TrafficLight.Green:
      print("Go!");
      break;
  }
}

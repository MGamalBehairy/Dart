when exception occured, the app will crash 
so we need to handle with this exceptions

* Syntax with Exceptions *
try{} catch(e) {}                            /// this called   try-catch block      and "e" shortcut for exceptions


try{
  // try this code (execute this code)
  // if no exceptions happened, then it will be fine and ignore the "catch" block

  but if exceptions occured, then throw this exceptions to the "e" variable  (so now "e" store the data of this exception)
  // and then   ignore the "try" block and execute the "catch" block
}
catch(){
  
}



if u know or want to be specific of type of exception, u can use it 

try{}                                                                                                                                                            , like    if {}
on RangeError {}            // RangeError: is a type of exceptions,    so if the exception was from RangeError, then the code within this block will be executed,     and  this like else-if
on HttpException{}
catch (e){}                 //  and also u can use catch(){}      its like the default  block,    if the exception type was non of the above exception types u determined, then the catch block will be executed ,    so  catch(){}   is like  else{}





void main()
{
List colors = ['black'];

  try{
    print(colors[5]);    
  }
  catch(e) {
    print(e);    // print e  to see the exception message (or to tell the user about the problem)
  }
}

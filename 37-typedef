typedef =>> is a shortcut for function type OR reserved keyword that gives an existing datatype a "nickname"

Ex. 
Imageine you have a long street name:

"King Abdulaziz Road, Building 12, Apartment 5"

But instead of saying this long name every time, you create a shortcut name:  "My Home"
Now, every time someone asks you where you live, you just say "My Home", and they know what you mean.

Ex. Traditional way
void calculator (double Function(double, double) operation, double x, double y) {
  print("Result ${operation(x, y)}");
}

double add (double a, double b) {
  return a + b;
}

double multiply (double a, double b) {
  return a* b;
}
void main() {

}


Ex2 // without typedef
char user1[25]= "Mohamed";

// INSTEAD, using typedef

typedef user char[25];
void main()
{
  user user1 = "Mohamed";            =>> user is Equal to " char [25]; " 
}

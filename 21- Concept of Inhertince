one class can inherit another class, dart can creat a new class from existing class
- use "extends" keyword to inherit

* Syntax *
class Parent_Class{
....
}

class child_Class extend Parent_Class{
...
}

Ex.

class names {
  void output() {
    print("Welcome to programming!\nYou are inside the void function");
  }
}

class child_name extends names {}

void main() {
  var name1 = new child_name();
  name1.output();
}

* Types of Inheritance: *
1- Single Inheritance: This inheritance occurs when a class inherits a single-parent class.
2- Multiple Inheritance: This inheritance occurs when a class inherits more than one parent class.     ////  "Dart doesnâ€™t support this"  /////
3- Multi-Level Inheritance: This inheritance occurs when a class inherits another child class.
4- Hierarchical Inheritance: More than one classes have the same parent class.

 Important POINTS:
 - Dart doesn't support Multiple Inheritence
 - Child Class inherit all propertes and Methods EXCEPT "Constructor" of Parent Class

 /// Constructor /// : is Special Method (function) in a class that Called Automatically when an object of the class is created

1- Arithmetic Operation

~/, +,  -,  *,  /,  %,   -expr => ex.  -a = -2 (if a = 2)
Important:
~/  => convert the output to Integer

var c = 9 / 4    // output = 2.25
var c = 9 ~/ 4    // output = 2

Using unary minus


2- Type Test Operators
NOTE it doesn't test Valuse but compare with data type
is  ,  is !    // output is boolean
Ex.
var a = 2;
var b = "mohamed";

print (a is int)  // output = true or 1
print(b is !string) // output = false or 0
//print(a is 2)  // Error, can't compare with values only with data types
